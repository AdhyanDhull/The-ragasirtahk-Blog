About [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/):

> Netlify CMS is an open source content management system for your Git workflow that enables you to provide editors with friendly UI and intuitive workflow. You can use it with any static site generator to create faster, more flexible web projects. Content is stored in your Git repository alongside your code for easier versioning, multi-channel publishing, and the option to handle content updates directly in Git.

In this guide I am going to show you how to setup Netlify CMS on a Hugo based site. The **prerequisites **for the next steps are:

* A Hugo website/blog
* GitHub account and basic usage
* A Netlify Account

**Alternatively, **If you do not want to create a website on Hugo before continuing and just want the format of this blog then follow the steps here.
